	Method annotation used for methods that should be invoked once the page is fully loaded. This is useful for one-time component initializations that can't be done at instantance initialzation time, such as refrerences to embedded components or blocks.
	<br />
	PageLoaded methods should take no parameters and return void. They must either have this annotation, or be named "pageLoaded".
